[*Highly recommended for absolute beginners *]



**Input-Process-Output[IPO] Model** [*check the diagrams ipocycle and Ipocycledetails*]

A computer program or any other sort of process using the input-process-output model receives inputs from a user or other source, does some computations on the inputs, and returns the results of the computations. The system divides the work into three categories:

**A requirement from the environment. Information that is passed to the computer by the programmer/user.(*input*)**


**A computation based on the requirement. Set of instructions given to the computer to perform a certain task. (*process*)**


**A provision for the environment. Information passed from the computer to the user/programmer. (*output*)**

**Algorithm.**

An algorithm is a set of instructions or rules designed to solve a definite problem. The problem can be simple like adding two numbers or a complex one, such as converting a video file from one format to another.

For example, a program might be written to convert Fahrenheit temperatures into Celsius temperatures. Following the IPO model, the program must:

Ask the user for the Fahrenheit temperature (input)
Perform a calculation to convert the Fahrenheit temperature into the corresponding Celsius temperature (process)
Display the Celsius temperature (output)


**PseudoCode.**

Function Main
    
    #This program converts an input Fahrenheit #temperature to Celsius.

    Declare Real fahrenheit
    Declare Real celsius
    
    Output "Enter Fahrenheit temperature:"
    Input fahrenheit

    Assign celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9

    Output fahrenheit & "째 Fahrenheit is " & celsius & "째 Celsius"
End

**Output**


Enter Fahrenheit temperature:

100

100째 Fahrenheit is 37.7777777777778째 Celsius


**FlowChart.**

**Code Block**:

In Python, code block refers to a collection of code that is in the same block or indent. This is most commonly found in classes, functions, and loops.

You can where code blocks are because they are 1) on the same indent and 2) are uninterrupted by other lines of code not on the same indent.
