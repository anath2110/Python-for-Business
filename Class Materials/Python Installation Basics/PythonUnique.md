# Why Python?

Python is one of the most popular and fastest-growing programming languages. Inherently, it is *interpreted, high-level, general-purpose, and object-oriented scripting language*, which means the following:

**Interpreted** - an interpreter processes the source file at runtime, it reads the lines of code one by one and performs what is said. Similarly to Perl and PHP, Python does not require that you compile your program before executing it. So, you do not have to invoke a compiler. Instead of running the compiler that helps turn source files into compiled class files, you simply run a .py file. Python byte code compilation is automatic and entirely implicit.


**High-level** - Python relies on easy-to-read structures that are later translated into a low-level language, the original code that is run on a computer’s central processing unit (CPU). A high-level language is intended to be used by a programmer and the written code is further interpreted into a low-level language. Like C++ or Java, before running, Python has to be processed. This enables Python’s portability — it can run on different kinds of computers with nearly no modifications.



**General-purpose** - Python can be used for nearly everything. It is applicable to almost every field for a variety of tasks. Be it the execution of such short-term tasks as software testing or long-term product development that involves roadmap planning, Python works well for them all, it is applicable all over the map. Its roles are unlimited. It is popular not only among software engineers, but also among specialists in other fields: mathematics, data analysis, science, accounting, and network engineering. Likewise, Python cliques with young people because it’s a very beginner-friendly scripting language.


**Object-oriented**- this programming paradigm gives an overall orientation towards scripting and powerful code structuring. This object-oriented approach allows thinking of problems in terms of classes and objects. Then, objects are composed in such a way to make up complex computer programs. Beside the object-oriented programming, Python also supports a procedural paradigm. With OOP being only one of the options, you can make Python programming more advanced by going for an object-oriented programming approach. Developers can create reusable patterns of code thus curtailing redundancy in development projects.


## Advantages over other languages:


**Simple.** Python is a readable and understandable language. As a result, when a problem occurs, the developer can focus on it, not on the language complexity.

**Free of charge.** This programming technology is free and open. The developers can share, copy, and change it. As a result, Python has a good community and evolves fast. As for the community, it provides an opportunity to share knowledge with junior specialists.


**Compatible.** Python offers compatibility with various platforms. So, the developers don’t face the issues that are common for other languages.
Object-oriented. Python supports procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming. The first type offers to apply reusable pieces of code. As for OOP, it utilizes objects that are based on data and functionality.

**Flexibility.** Although Python puts emphasis on code simplicity and readability rather than flexibility, the language still has it. Python is usable across different projects. It allows developers to choose between object-oriented and procedural programming modes. Python is flexible in data type, too. There are 5 of them: Number, String, List, Tuple, and Dictionary and every sub-data type corresponds to one of these root types. As a result, the exploratory data analysis becomes easier to conduct due to Python’s flexibility.


**Portability.** Python is designed to be portable. Its programs are supported on any modern computer OS. Owing to the high-level nature of the language, Python script is interpreted, so it can be written for further interpretation equally well on Linux, Windows, Mac OS, and UNIX without demanding for adjustments. Python programs also allow implementing portable GUIs.

**Development speed.** Python is a dynamic scripting language, so it isn’t intended for writing applications from scratch but it’s primarily intended for plugging together components. Components are designed to be reusable while the interfaces between components and scripts are well-defined. It all accelerates the speed of software development with Python making the language highly concise and productive.


**Powerful Toolbox/libraries.** There are a lot of libraries for Python. As a result, the developers can manage documentation, databases, web browsers, perform unit testing, and so on. Additionally, Python can be used for many tasks, e.g. web and desktop apps development, complex calculation systems, life support management systems, Internet of Things, games, and more.
Inherently, Python programs are text files containing instructions for the interpreter and are written in a text editor or IDE. IDEs are full-featured and offer in-built tools like syntax checkers, debuggers and code browsers, text editors do not normally include IDE features but they can be customized. Python also has a huge array of third-party packages, libraries, and frameworks that facilitate the development process. These optimization capabilities thus make Python great for large-scale projects.
