# Python Collections (Arrays)
### There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

* List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
* Dictionary is a collection which is ordered* and changeable. No duplicate members.


** *As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.**

*When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.*
